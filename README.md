# PaddleBattle
Paddle Battle: A multiplayer action game with pong-like mechanics (in early development)

Paddle Battle is a hobby project of mine. It's my first dive into game development, and I've been really enjoying it so far.
I don't really have an end goal in mind, I mostly just add/edit stuff that I want to add/edit.
However, I do want the game to eventually have items/powerups, maps/gamemodes, online multiplayer, and some type of singleplayer experience.

With that being said, I hope you find enjoyment in Paddle Battle. Any feedback, be it praise, suggestions, or criticisms, is greatly appreciated.

## How to play

Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/Aidunlin/PaddleBattle/releases) and grab the latest Paddle Battle zip.
Extract and run the exe (some releases have a pck file, be sure to keep it in the same directory).

Press start, enter, or keypad enter on your input device to join the game.

Controls:
* Controller - Left stick to move, right stick to rotate, left trigger to sprint
* Keyboard (WASD) - WASD to move, G and H to rotate, shift to sprint
* Keyboard (arrows/keypad) - Arrow keys to move, keypad 2 and 3 to rotate, keypad 1 to sprint

Your objective is to bounce balls off of the enemy paddle's back side, causing them to lose health. How you do this is up to you.
Whether you want to send a flurry of balls at your foes in the hopes that they'll be overwhelmed,
or send a few calculated shots that precisely deflect around the map, one thing is for certain:
you are a paddle. And this is Paddle Battle.
