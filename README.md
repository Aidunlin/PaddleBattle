Paddle Battle: A multiplayer action game with pong-like mechanics (in early development)

Paddle Battle is a hobby project of mine. It's my first dive into game development, and I've been really enjoying it so far. I mostly just add/edit stuff that I want to add/edit. I do want the game to eventually have items/powerups, maps/gamemodes, online multiplayer, and some type of singleplayer experience, among other things.

With that being said, I hope you find enjoyment in Paddle Battle. Any feedback, be it praise, suggestions, or criticisms, is greatly appreciated.

## How to play

Head over to the [releases page](https://github.com/Aidunlin/PaddleBattle/releases) and download the latest zip. Extract and run the exe (some releases have a .pck file, be sure to keep it in the same directory).

Press start, enter, or keypad enter on your input device to join the game. Two people can play on a full-size keyboard!

Controls as of 0.3.0:
* Controller - Left stick to move, right stick to rotate, left trigger to sprint
* Keyboard (left side) - WASD to move, G and H to rotate, shift to sprint
* Keyboard (right side) - Arrow keys to move, keypad 2 and 3 to rotate, keypad 1 to sprint

Note that controls, mechanics, and features will change and have changed across releases prior to 1.0. The full release will include customizable key binds, game options, and more.

Your objective is to bounce balls off of the enemy paddle's back side, causing them to lose health. How you do this is up to you. Whether you want to send a flurry of balls at your foes in the hopes that they'll be overwhelmed, or send a few calculated shots that precisely deflect around the map, one thing is for certain: you are a paddle. And this is Paddle Battle.

## Next update - 0.4.0 (ETA December 2020)

0.4.0 will introduce online multiplayer via a unified experience, similar to how a game like Duck Game handles multiplayer. For example, you can have multiple people playing on a computer that is hosting a session with other computers.

Some multiplayer features like client-side prediction/interpolation and lag compensation might not be included in the 0.4.0 release, but instead in a 0.4.x patch.
